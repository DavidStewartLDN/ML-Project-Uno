# ML Project 

This is our first machine learning project created to deepen our understanding of Machine Learning.

Our approach to this project will be to build out the functionality in phases and to slowly build each part of the app like a module rather than begin with a mammoth task of cleaning a large dataset up.

Instead, we aim to start with a simple data set, alogrithm and visualisation, then build out each part in a logical order.

This readme will be updated shortly to reflect changes in the project!
